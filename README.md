Hello-world tutorial

Hello.  I used to be a real time C coder on VMS.  It was great fun. Then I focused on UI's using Lotus Notes and SQL back ends.  Now I'm updating my skills by learning Swift 3, Xcode 8.1, and iOS 10.  I'd like to develop for the Mac too, but iOS seems to be the rage currently.
